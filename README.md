Project Description:

Developed a decentralized application (dApp) using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain to ensure transparency, traceability, and security in the pharmaceutical supply chain. The system enables real-time tracking of drug batches from manufacturers to end pharmacies, reducing the risk of counterfeit drugs and ensuring product authenticity.

The dApp records every transaction — from manufacturing to distribution — as immutable entries on the blockchain, allowing regulators and consumers to verify the origin and movement of drugs. Each participant in the chain (manufacturer, distributor, transporter, pharmacy, regulator) is assigned a verified blockchain identity, ensuring trust and accountability.

Key Features:

Decentralized Tracking: Each drug batch is registered on the Ethereum blockchain with a unique ID and metadata (e.g., batch number, manufacture date, IPFS document hash).

Role-Based Access Control: Only authorized entities (manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, regulators) can perform specific actions.

Immutable Provenance: Every transfer, location update, and custody change is permanently stored on-chain for auditability.

Drug Recall Mechanism: Regulators can recall faulty or counterfeit drug batches across the entire chain.

Transparency & Security: Eliminates centralized intermediaries, reducing fraud and ensuring data integrity.

Integration with IPFS: Used for storing drug certificates, safety reports, and related documents off-chain.

Technologies Used:

Blockchain Platform: Ethereum

Smart Contract Language: Solidity

Tools & Frameworks: Remix IDE, MetaMask, Ganache / Hardhat

Frontend (optional): React.js + Ethers.js (for dApp interface)

Off-Chain Storage: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
